# GarnetChat
The chatting system for Garnets!

##[Try it out!](https://preview.c9users.io/ignis99/garnetchat/index.html)
There are no running servers at the moment (there's one for development but it's down most of the time), so you'll need to [run your own](https://github.com/limdingwen/Erika) if you want to test it out.

Simply open the HTML file to run the program. The app would ask to connect to a server, which could be found here: [Erika](https://github.com/limdingwen/Erika)
